# Terraform
## Ignore all .terraform directories recursively
**/.terraform/

## Ignore local state files and backups - these should ideally be in a remote backend
# If you are using local state and NOT committing it (recommended for local state):
**/*.tfstate
**/*.tfstate.*

## Ignore crash logs and plan files
crash.log
*.tfplan

## Ignore override files
override.tf
override.tf.json
*_override.tf
*_override.tf.json

# Terraform lock file - DO NOT ignore the .terraform.lock.hcl at the root of each configuration directory
# This file should be committed to version control.
# The following lines ensure that if one was accidentally ignored by a broader pattern,
# it's explicitly un-ignored. However, the patterns above are generally specific enough.
# !.terraform.lock.hcl
# !*/.terraform.lock.hcl # If you have configurations in subdirectories like 'cloudflare/'

# Python (Good to have for Part 2 later)
