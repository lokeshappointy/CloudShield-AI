# cf.colo.id
++++++++++++


	Meaning: This is the Cloudflare data center (colo) ID that handled the request.
	Use Case: Identifies which Cloudflare edge location processed the request.

Example:
++++++++

	characteristics = ["ip.src", "cf.colo.id"]
	This rate limiting rule tracks request count per unique combination of source IP and edge location.
	This means:
	👉 "Track how many requests a particular IP makes from a specific Cloudflare edge (colo), and apply the rate limit based on that."
	This is helpful when the same IP might be routed through different edge servers, and you want to rate-limit each instance independently.
	
Why it's useful:
++++++++++++++++

	Reduces false positives in distributed environments
	Helps distribute rate limits across multiple data centers
	Improves granularity and accuracy of rate limiting



✅ Why do we need modules/waf/variables.tf and modules/ratelimit/variables.tf when we already have variables.tf in the root?

The answer lies in how Terraform modules work:

The root module (main.tf, variables.tf, etc.) passes data into child modules via module blocks.

Each child module (modules/waf, modules/ratelimit) needs to explicitly declare the variables it expects via its own variables.tf.

🔁 So even though the structure is repetitive, it’s necessary for Terraform to pass values from root → module.
